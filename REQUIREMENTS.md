# Civic Angular Component
[The Bounty](https://cdp.civic.com/forums/1)

### Overview
A reusable component that displays a Sign In button, triggers the Civic QR-code when clicked, and handles the response events. Needs to be configurable so each Angular app that uses the component can have unique credentials.

### Deliverables
A finished, working module that outputs a Sign In component in any Angular app. The module will display a button (Sign In) that will trigger the Civic SIP library (see <a href="https://docs.civic.com">documentation</a>). The QR-code sign in will leverage API keys from a Civic integration account (https://integrate.civic.com), so a configuration file will be a necessary part of this project. The module will export the returned user data as an object for use in the app (Demo could simply console log this data).
