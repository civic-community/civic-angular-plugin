# Civic Angular Component
## Bounty: $1,500

### Overview
A reusable component that displays a Sign In button, triggers the Civic QR-code when clicked, and handles the response events. Needs to be configurable so each Angular app that uses the component can have unique credentials.

### Deliverables
- A finished, working module that outputs a Sign In component in any Angular app. 
- The module will display a button (Sign In) that will trigger the Civic SIP library (see <a href="https://docs.civic.com">documentation</a>). 
- The QR-code sign in will leverage API keys from a Civic integration account (https://integrate.civic.com). 
- A mock server with an updatable configuration file will be a necessary part of this project. 
- The module will export the returned user data from the mock server as an object for use in the frontend app (Demo could simply console log this data).
- Module needs to be properly namespaced and customizable where it makes sense (button label, etc...)
